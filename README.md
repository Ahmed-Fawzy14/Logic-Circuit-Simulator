This is a logic circuit similator that requires a .cir, .stim, .lib files and will write the output in the provided .sim file. The order your inputs in the .cir file is how they are assigned to the expression in the program, and the names of the inputs in the .stim files and .cir file are matching i.e. if you want to provide an input for A it should be labeled that way in the .cir. Provided in the simulator are 6 test circuits and if you would like to create a custom cirucit just create a similar file to the files under Test Circuits and provide your file paths.
